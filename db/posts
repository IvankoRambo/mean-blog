{"title":"Post 0: Revival","text":"<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It was a long time ago since I posted something, suppose like almost five years went by or even more. Formerly my last blog (called the same way), based on LAMP stack, was lost&nbsp;irretrievably. It had no backups on local machine, wasn't pushed to remote repository (e.g. Bitbucket or Github), as alternative I just placed it on FTP service and made all changes only on that one. I've never expected that data could be lost, because of cleared cookies and typical password fatigue, I always supposed that the worst&nbsp; I can expect for is a server glitch.</p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">But everything could happen in life: even the worst guy in a class could guess all tests and get an A, even everything could be as if you woke up, stood, went to shower, but afterwards you wake up indeed and appeared it was an odd dream, and you're late for your job, gym, visit of grandma or no matters what. The only thing matters that all you can say about this situation is 'Wasted!'. And that all I could say, when I forgot password and when hosting time was lost.</p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It was a big desire to recover it from scratch, but I was too&nbsp;<strike>busy</strike>&nbsp;lazy to make it up again. Plus, as for me, it was a ridiculous thing to create the same thing twice. In 2015 LAMP stack seemed to me not so interested and fine as it was before. In 2015 I got to know what NodeJS is. And in spite of it has no multi-threading support, it has a real sophisticated way concurrency, modules of various levels of 'I will do this for you', the great open source community (and yes, the first thing that I saw on NPM site was a strange picture of guy named TJ Holowaychuk, and even his old-fashioned style for 2015 year seemed to me as something interesting and suitable for this crowd).</p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\">So in this case I just though, why just not to recover blog, but use for this MEAN stack, especially if you've never launched this bundle from very scratch.&nbsp;</p>","postDate":1521410860316,"_id":"s30rx5PHmXY1gPZ4"}
